Just completed my mini project - "Expense tracker" by using C language.

This little project turned out to be such a funny way to apply all the core C concepts - from loops,arrays,structures,enums,typedef,unions,pointers to file handling - all working together to make something practical

The program helps to add,edit,delete,search,and view daily expenses,storing everything safely through file handling

It's simple,smart,and yes - coded with love!
